## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My Main Projects
- Octree Programming. An early start of my programming career begun with understanding the concept of octree within a 3 dimensional space. I decided for my implementation to be in a popular game named Minecraft for querying cuboid and polygonal regions for basic collision detection. https://github.com/harry0198/ProtectionAPI
- I furthered my understanding of SQL in my project MailMe. Once again using the game Minecraft as a graphical output of the results, this time producing an in game Mail storage solution. I also explored the usage of gradle here. https://github.com/harry0198/MailMe
